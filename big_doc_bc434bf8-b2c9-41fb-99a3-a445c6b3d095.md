## What is Knowl

Knowl is helping developers save time by disrupting documentation and dollaboration. It enables remote teams to work together asynchronously by connecting the teams and content. Knowl will the be home of developers days where they plan their day, write docs, manage tasks and collaborate with team members

## The Immediate Problem We are solving - 

### 

Developers are ~50% less productive because of [Stackoverflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work-challenges-at-work) - Poor documentation is  2nd biggest challenges at work for developers. 

### Why is documentation poor

Existing Apps are not built for DevelopersNot integrated with systems & workflow of developersCan’t access and update docs when needed from Github, Code Editor, issues monitors & other systemsNo continuous documentation with CI/CD, & code review workflowAnd Information that team needs is trapped in multiple apps Code is in repo, doc in wiki, diagram in one and API doc in other.information across apps can’t be linked and searched anywhereGaps - in skills, know-how & intent

- Good documentation is not rewarded and recognized
- 
    - Also there is no help from the tool to support this
- Not enough mentorship & training
- 
    - Overlooked during coding training like testing and devops
- Some devs are lazy 
- 
    - they may be less effecting in coding 

## The Solution

Developer first productivity tools for the team having deep integrations with devlopers work flow and are connected to different data source - code, ci / cd pipeline, tasks, documents. Do, Plan, Measure your and team’s worksIntegrated with Dev tools- Docs as Code

- with Git, code editors, alert manager, pm , communication
- Open, edit and collaborate in WSYWYG and Markdown editors

Introduce docs to CI / CD - Continuous Documentation

- Link docs with code
- Review and commit as code
- Alerts for out of sync documents

Create & Manage all Knowledge in Knowl

- Create PRD, Diagrams, Test Cases, API Designs, Charts and more 
- Bring Code comments, Commit history in the doc auto

- Developer Demand is growing at 21%
- Teams have bigger budgets now

VC are investing more in Dev Tools

### Tech IP

Knowl is building the fasted editor that will be used for all use cases for the tech teams 

- Project documentation
- Project management 
- AI based recommendation to improve project performance 
- Incident management
- Workflow automation for dev ops
- one source of all information of the proejct 

- Home page of the project and the developers

## Risks

- Large market but niche for one team. If developer demand budget suddently drops for any reason then Knowl might struggle to scale. However, this drop seems very unlikely in the next 5-10 years or more.
- If large enterprises - Google, Microssoft, Atlassian go head on with Knowl’s solution in the inital stages, then Knowl might struggle to scale
- Switching to Knowl will be the key to success. Although it’s a far better product but if customer’s resist to switch for unforseeable reasons then Knowl might struggle to scale

## The Immediate Problem We are solving - 

### 

Developers are ~50% less productive because of [Stackoverflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work-challenges-at-work) - Poor documentation is  2nd biggest challenges at work for developers. 

### Why is documentation poor

Existing Apps are not built for DevelopersNot integrated with systems & workflow of developersCan’t access and update docs when needed from Github, Code Editor, issues monitors & other systemsNo continuous documentation with CI/CD, & code review workflowAnd Information that team needs is trapped in multiple apps Code is in repo, doc in wiki, diagram in one and API doc in other.information across apps can’t be linked and searched anywhereGaps - in skills, know-how & intent

- Good documentation is not rewarded and recognized
- 
    - Also there is no help from the tool to support this
- Not enough mentorship & training
- 
    - Overlooked during coding training like testing and devops
- Some devs are lazy 
- 
    - they may be less effecting in coding 

## The Solution

Developer first productivity tools for the team having deep integrations with devlopers work flow and are connected to different data source - code, ci / cd pipeline, tasks, documents. Do, Plan, Measure your and team’s worksIntegrated with Dev tools- Docs as Code

- with Git, code editors, alert manager, pm , communication
- Open, edit and collaborate in WSYWYG and Markdown editors

Introduce docs to CI / CD - Continuous Documentation

- Link docs with code
- Review and commit as code
- Alerts for out of sync documents

Create & Manage all Knowledge in Knowl

- Create PRD, Diagrams, Test Cases, API Designs, Charts and more 
- Bring Code comments, Commit history in the doc auto

## GTM

### Leads / EM

Features / Pitch

- Keep your architecture, design, and KT documents always in sync with code
- Enforce a process to commit document along with doc

How to Reach

- Parntership with other developer tools 
- 
    - yet to explore how our integrations with different tools make it a natural way to grow
- SEO & Digital marketing - SEM

### Developers

Pitch

- Biggest library for tech only template - Architecture diagrams, ERD diagram for all domains, RCA docs, PRDs, design docs
- Fastest Rich Editor that can be open in markdown within your favorite code editor
- Find docs in the code editor along with your code 

How to Reach

- Developer communities in Reddit, Stackoverflow, Slack, Discord, and quora

## What’s in our favour

### Team & Market Fit

- 
    - Seasoned Entrepreneurs, Techies, and Product guys 
    - Sovling deep tech problem for themselves and team’s like theirs

/code snipk

### Category is ripe for disruption

Need is Now & Pressing | Customer is Ready | Ecosystem is ReadyCollaboration is The Need in Hybrid Culture

- 60% increase in collaboration apps in the 
- Continuous Documentation in a state where DevOps was in 2014 - ripe for disruption

Developer is the king & has bigger budgets 

- Developer Demand is growing at 21%
- Teams have bigger budgets now

VC are investing more in Dev Tools

- $37b invested in 2021 in Dev Tools
- 2x increase in VC investment in just 5 years

### Tech IP

Knowl is building the fasted editor that will be used for all use cases for the tech teams 

- Project documentation
- Project management 
- AI based recommendation to improve project performance 
- Incident management
- Workflow automation for dev ops
- one source of all information of the proejct 

- Home page of the project and the developers

## Risks

- Large market but niche for one team. If developer demand budget suddently drops for any reason then Knowl might struggle to scale. However, this drop seems very unlikely in the next 5-10 years or more.
- If large enterprises - Google, Microssoft, Atlassian go head on with Knowl’s solution in the inital stages, then Knowl might struggle to scale
- Switching to Knowl will be the key to success. Although it’s a far better product but if customer’s resist to switch for unforseeable reasons then Knowl might struggle to scale





Knowl is helping developers save time by disrupting documentation and dollaboration. It enables remote teams to work together asynchronously by connecting the teams and content. Knowl will the be home of developers days where they plan their day, write docs, manage tasks and collaborate with team members

### Category is ripe for disruption

Need is Now & Pressing | Customer is Ready | Ecosystem is ReadyCollaboration is The Need in Hybrid Culture

- 60% increase in collaboration apps in the 
- Continuous Documentation in a state where DevOps was in 2014 - ripe for disruption

Developer is the king & has bigger budgets 

- Developer Demand is growing at 21%
- Teams have bigger budgets now

VC are investing more in Dev Tools

- $37b invested in 2021 in Dev Tools
- 2x increase in VC investment in just 5 years

### Tech IP

Knowl is building the fasted editor that will be used for all use cases for the tech teams 

- Project documentation
- Project management 
- AI based recommendation to improve project performance 
- Incident management
- Workflow automation for dev ops
- one source of all information of the proejct 

- Home page of the project and the developers

## Risks

- Large market but niche for one team. If developer demand budget suddently drops for any reason then Knowl might struggle to scale. However, this drop seems very unlikely in the next 5-10 years or more.
- If large enterprises - Google, Microssoft, Atlassian go head on with Knowl’s solution in the inital stages, then Knowl might struggle to scale
- Switching to Knowl will be the key to success. Although it’s a far better product but if customer’s resist to switch for unforseeable reasons then Knowl might struggle to scale
